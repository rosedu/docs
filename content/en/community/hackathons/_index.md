## Unikraft Hackathons

We organize hackathons to help people make their first steps in Unikraft and learn more about operating systems, virtualizaion and unikernel technology.

We aim to have hackathons as face-to-face events for maximum support from the Unikraft community members acting as teaching assistants (TAs) and support crew.
In any case (face-to-face or strict only), the hackathon will also take place on [Unikraft Discord](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord) with talks / presentations, breakout rooms and virtual support from Unikraft TAs.

If you want to host a Unikraft hackathon, please [get in touch with us](https://unikraft.org/community/contacts/).
You'll get to expose your students, or members of your technical community to the cool topics behind open source OS development with Unikraft.
