## Unikraft Open Source Community

Unikraft is developed in the spirit of open source: public discussions on [Discord](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord), open source licensing model using [BSD-3-Clause](docs/contributing/licensing), public development and management on [GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/).

It does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists.
Periodic meetings, hackathons and a consistent presence in open source events are central to the well functioning of the community.

We use a [guidelines for development and maintenance](docs/contributing/) to ensure the creation of high quality code.

Public releases are planned to happen once every two months.
In general, we aim for a public release to happen at the last Monday of each odd month (January, March, May, etc.)

We welcome contributors and users on [Discord](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/).
If you are looking for a fun technical project in the area of operating systems, virtualization, come aboard on Discord.
